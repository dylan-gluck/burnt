# Overview

This plan outlines the phased implementation of porting the Ink CLI library to a Bun-native implementation leveraging Effect for type-safe error handling, resource management, and dependency injection while maintaining 100% API compatibility with the original Ink library.

**Key Objectives:**
- 100% API compatibility with Ink's public interface
- Leverage Effect for typed errors, services, and resource management
- Use Bun's native APIs and performance optimizations
- Integrate React 19 features (ref as prop, use() hook, Context as provider)
- Achieve 50%+ faster startup time and 30%+ lower memory usage vs. Ink

**Architecture Approach:**
- Data structures first (render tree, layout info)
- Service layer with Effect patterns
- React reconciler integration
- Component and hook API last (following specs exactly)
