# Risk Mitigation

**Identified risks:**

1. **Yoga Layout Integration Complexity**
   - Impact: High - Core layout depends on it
   - Likelihood: Medium - FFI or npm package may have issues
   - Mitigation: Test both approaches early (Phase 3), choose most stable

2. **React Reconciler API Stability**
   - Impact: High - Core rendering depends on stable API
   - Likelihood: Low - React 19 reconciler is stable
   - Mitigation: Pin React version, abstract reconciler interface

3. **Performance Targets May Not Be Met**
   - Impact: Medium - Performance is a key goal
   - Likelihood: Low - Bun and Effect are designed for performance
   - Mitigation: Benchmark early and often, optimize hot paths

4. **Effect Learning Curve**
   - Impact: Medium - Team may need time to learn Effect patterns
   - Likelihood: Medium - Effect is different from traditional TypeScript
   - Mitigation: Provide Effect pattern examples, code reviews

5. **API Compatibility Edge Cases**
   - Impact: Medium - 100% compatibility required
   - Likelihood: Medium - Edge cases may differ
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing against Ink examples
