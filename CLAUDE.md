# Effect / Bun CLI

1. Effect Patterns: Service/Layer, Effect.gen, typed errors, dependency injection
2. Type Safety: Schema validation, strict TypeScript, compile-time error tracking
3. Testing: `bun:test`, Mock layers, Effect test runners, comprehensive coverage
4. Code Quality: Biome for linting/formatting, strict TS configuration
5. Resource Management: Proper cleanup via Effect's resource management
6. Platform Integration: @effect/platform-node for Node.js/Bun compatibility
